A manga downloader for [MangaDex.org](https://mangadex.org/), Using the new [API](https://api.mangadex.org/docs.html).
## Inspiration
If these projects weren't available, mangadex-py would be a gallimaufry of python code.  
some snippets were taken from them.  
1. [manga-py](https://github.com/manga-py/manga-py)
2. [mangadex-dl](https://github.com/frozenpandaman/mangadex-dl)
3. [MangaDex.py](https://github.com/Proxymiity/MangaDex.py)
## Requirements
- Python >= 3 should be fine.
## How to use

1. Install the package  
The project had to be named Sydiepus-mangadex-py because 'mangadex-py' was creating conflict with another package.
```
pip3 install Sydiepus-mangadex-py 
# or
pip install Sydiepus-mangadex-py
```
### To upgrade 
```
pip install --upgrade Sydiepus-mangadex-py
# or
pip3 install --upgrade Sydiepus-mangadex-py
```

2. Use program.

mangadex-py <url or uuid>

### Downloading Manga

- By default a 'series.json' will be created inside manga_name folder like [Mylar](https://github.com/mylar3/mylar3/wiki/series.json-examples) to be used by a comic server e.g  : [komga](https://github.com/gotson/komga)
```
mangadex-py mangadexurl/uuid -t 4 #download with 4 threads.

mangadex-py mangadexurl/uuid -l ru #download russian manga translation.

mangadex-py mangadexurl/uuid -ds data-save #download compressed images.

mangadex-py mangadexurl/uuid -d Books #will download to pwd/Books/manganame/

mangadex-py mangadexurl/uuid --name 'Manga Name' #change manga directory name

mangadex-py -F Manga.txt #will use pwd/Manga.txt as source of mangadexurl and manga name
```
